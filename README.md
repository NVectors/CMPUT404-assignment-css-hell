For part 1, I downloaded the project gutenberg document's .htm files and renamed the file to gutenberg_.html (_ being the 1st, 2nd or 3rd document).<br>
I commented out the code within the style tag **<style type="text/css">** <br>
I replaced the style tag with the a link tag <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/> referencing the css file.<br>
I placed the code within the **<style type="text/css">** tag into the **style.css** for the first project gutenberg html.<br>
For the second and third project gutenberg document, I just made sure I copied styles with a specific class tag into **style.css**.<br> 
Lastly, I specifically added a shadow box, changed the font and changed the background color to emulate old paper.
