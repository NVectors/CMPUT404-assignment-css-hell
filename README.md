For part 1, I downloaded the project gutenberg document's .htm files and renamed the file to gutenberg_.html (_ being 1, 2 or 3).<br>
I commented out the code within the **<style type="text/css">** tag and replaced with a **<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>** tag.
I placed the code within the **<style type="text/css">** tag into the **style.css** for the first project gutenberg html.<br>
For the second and third project gutenberg document, I just made sure I copied styles with a specific class tag into **style.css**.<br> 
Lastly, I specifically added a shadow box, changed the font and changed the background color to emulate old paper.
